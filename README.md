# About FokLang
aka Foko (literally me)'s language inspired by haskell, nix and (in the future) perl. Mostly was inspired to make it because configs (why use universal stuff like json when i can have my own thing) and well... having your own language is,,, kinda cool I think?


TODO: Loops, Conditionals
# Installation
### For nix users:
* shell:
```nix
nix run gitub:fokohetman/foklang-temp
```
* future options...
### For others:
* shell:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fokohetman/foklang-temp
rustc shell.rs
./shell
```
> *requires git and rustc

# Usage

## Quick Introduction
Upon running shell, you will find yourself in foklang environment:
```
foklang$ 
```
### hello world
alright, time for... hello world I guess?
```
foklang$ println "hello foklang!!!"
hello foklang!!!
```
A bit of terminology:
* String, as any other type is called it's Latin word: `Filum`, however we're not using it here. <br>
* String in foklang, just like in haskell, is a list of `Ustulo` (chars, such as: `'h'`). So `"hello"` == `['h'; 'e'; 'l'; 'l'; 'o']`.<br>
### functions
<br>good i guess? Let's get to the cool stuff
```
foklang$ fn x y = x+y
```
what could that do? <br>Exactly! It defines a Moenus (function) that takes arguments (x,y), and adds them together.
<br>Let's see it in action
```
foklang$ fn 2 4
6
foklang$ add2 = fn 2

foklang$ add 2 10
12
foklang$ add2 5
7
```
neat, but why not start with variables?
### variables
Well, variables are basically "argumentless" functions
```
foklang$ NathansConfusion = 642
foklang$ NathansConfusion + 5
647
```
### lists
alright alright. What else do we have?
Lists, or if you prefer, `Inventarii`. 
These are pretty trivial:
```
foklang$ [1 2 3 4 5 6]
[1;2;3;4;5;6;]
```
huh? `;` is a default separator, however (unless you use identifiers, `x`, `variable` etc.) aren't needed
```
foklang$ let x = 5
foklang$ let list = [1 2 3 4 x; 5]
foklang$ list
1;2;3;4;5;5;
```
see? Separator (`;`) goes after identifier (otherwise identifier takes everything after it as argument).<br>


### objects/configs
Now, the last thing I got to offer you are Objects (or Configs, debatable).
```
foklang$ let var = 5
foklang$ let config = {enable = true offset = 16 variable = var; powers = 12}
foklang$
```
Notice how separators work the same way as in lists.<br>
Now that we got ourselves a config, let's use it!
```
foklang$ get config enable
true
foklang$ get config variable
5
foklang get config powers
12
```



## BuiltIn Functions

### builtin get
now, builtin function: `get`. 1st argument is a list or object (in 1st case, variable `list`, in 2nd variable `config`). 2nd argument is index or key. Index starts from 0, so:
```
foklang$ let list = [1 4 9 16 25 36]
foklang$ get list 3
4
foklang$ get list 0
1
foklang$ get list 4
5
foklang$ let config = {enable = true variable=12 multiplier = 17}
foklang$ get config variable
12
foklang$ get config multiplier + 3
20
```
etc.

## Common tasks
Loops? Nah, we got recursion (haskell reference)
```
foklang$ factorial 0 = 0; factorial 1 = 1
foklang$ factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
foklang$ factorial 5
120
```


neat. NOW WAIT FOR CONDITIONALS ~~AND LOOPS~~ BECAUSE I STILL DON'T HAVE THEM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
